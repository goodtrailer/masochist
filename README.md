### Overview
Attacking slowly consumes your HP, hence the title "masochist". This effect stops at 50%. HP only regenerates while not attacking. Attacking also slowly increases your level. Higher levels = faster attack speed.

Sprinting consumes stamina, which regenerates slowly.

Dodging gives very brief invincibility.
Bombing deals huge damage to all enemies on screen.
Limit Break doubles your damage *and* damage taken.

The red dot on your character is your true hitbox. You'll only take damage if the red dot gets hit.

The goal is to beat the game as fast as you can.
